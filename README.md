# Learn EE

This is a sample project utilizing ExpressionEngine, so you can follow along and build an EE site from scratch.

## Install

It is highly recommended that you watch the videos at [ExpressionEngine University](https://u.expressionengine.com/) to walk through the full installation process. This repo should serve as a guide to follow along.

If you want to install this repo:
1. `git clone git@github.com:dougblackjr/learn-ee.git`
2. Import the database from the database folder.

## Usage

Each branch in this repo will serve as a separate step in the video, so you are able to checkout any branch, and see the site that exists at the end of each video.

The `main` branch will serve as the most up to date version of the site
